## Requirements
The code is written in ```Python 3``` and has been tested with the following packages: ```cloudpickle 1.3.0``` or ```dill 0.3.2``` (for pickling lambda-functions), ```corner 2.0.1```, ```healpy 1.13.0```, ```matplotlib 3.1.1```, [```NPTFit 0.2```](https://github.com/bsafdi/NPTFit), ```numba 0.48.0```, ```numba 0.48.0```, ```psutil 5.7.0```, ```pymultinest 2.9```, ```ray 0.8.2```, ```scikit-learn 0.22.2```, ```scipy 1.4.1```, ```seaborn 0.10.0```, ```tensorboard 2.1.1```, ```tensorflow 2.1.0 ``` (currently in compatibility mode for TF 1), ```tensorflow-probability 0.9.0```, ```timeout-decorator 0.4.1```.

For generating point-source (PS) template maps, the tool [```NPTFit-Sim```](https://github.com/nickrodd/NPTFit-Sim) needs to be used.

This implementation borrows code from:
* https://github.com/deepsphere/DeepSphere
* https://github.com/mdeff/cnn_graph/
* https://github.com/deepsphere/paper-deepsphere-iclr2020/blob/51260d9169b9bff2f0d71d567c99909a17efd5e9/figures/kernel_widths.py
* https://github.com/yaringal/ConcreteDropout
* https://github.com/bsafdi/NPTFit/tree/master/examples

In particular, the neural network architecture is built on *DeepSphere* ([Perraudin et al. 2019](http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12186), [Defferrard et al. 2020](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1e3OlStPB)).

## Training the neural network
A good starting point is the Jupyter notebook ```Train_NN_Poisson_only.ipynb``` that shows how the neural network can be trained for the case of photon maps being composed of Poissonian templates only. For this case, no PS maps need to be generated, and the training and testing photon count maps are randomly generated on-the-fly with randomly drawn normalisations as specified by the priors. The hyperparameters need to be specified in the file ```parameters_CNN.py```. 

For including PSs, the script ```generate_data_per_model.py``` in the folder ```Scripts``` needs to be run in order to generate PS maps. Once the PS map generation is done, there are two options:
 1. Combine the PS maps with Poissonian template maps using the script ```combine_data_from_models.py```. Then, train the NN with NN type `CNN_pre` (hyperparameters in ```CNN_parameters_pre_gen.py```).
 2. Combine the PS maps with Poissonian template maps that are generated on-the-fly during the NN training. This can be done by setting the NN type to `CNN` (hyperparameters in ```CNN_parameters.py```).

An experimental U-Net implementation for the pixelwise regression is also included (the hyperparameters must be specified in the file ```parameters_UNet.py```), but has not been tested properly. Also, many options (in particular for the estimation of uncertainties) have not been fully implemented, yet, and not all combinations of hyperparameters / settings are supported. This github repo contains the current state of our neural network implementation and does not represent an official code release.
