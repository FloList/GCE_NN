The data here is for use with the ipython example notebooks provided with the
main code at https://github.com/bsafdi/NPTFit.

Details of the files provided are given below. All files are provided 
as npy files binned as nside=128 HEALPix maps.

===============================
========= Fermi Data ==========
===============================
Number of files: 3
File naming: fermidata_<datatype>.npy
Description:
    - counts: a subset of the Fermi data [photon counts]. In detail:
        - Energy Range: 2-20 GeV;
        - Time Period: Aug 4, 2008 to July 7, 2016 (413 weeks);
        - Event Class: UltracleanVeto (1024);
        - Event Type: PSF3 (32);
        - Quality Cuts: DATA_QUAL==1 && LAT_CONFIG==1; and
        - Max Zenith Angle: 90 degrees
    - exposure: the exposure map associated with the above data [cm^2 s]
    - pscmask: mask of all point sources in the 3FGL at 1 degree; the mask also
               includes large extended objects like the LMC [boolean array]
               Point sources are masked at 95% containment according to the
               Fermi point spread function at 2 GeV

===============================
==== Background Templates =====
===============================
Number of files: 6
File naming: template_<model>.npy
Description:
    - dif: the p6v11 model of diffuse Galactic emission
    - iso: isotropic emission
    - psc: all point sources in the 3FGL
    - bub: the Fermi Bubbles
    - gce: a line of sight integrated NFW squared profile, used as a model
           for the galactic centre excess
    - dsk: a thin disk used as a spatial template for galactic point sources
Details:
    All templates have been exposure corrected, so that they are maps of counts
    not flux.
